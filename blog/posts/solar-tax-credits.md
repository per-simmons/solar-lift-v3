# Understanding Solar Tax Credits in 2025

The federal solar investment tax credit (ITC) continues to be one of the most significant financial incentives for homeowners considering solar installation. Let's break down what you need to know for 2025.

## Current Tax Credit Rates

As of 2025, homeowners can claim a **30% tax credit** on the total cost of their solar system installation. This includes:

- Solar panels
- Inverters
- Mounting equipment
- Battery storage systems
- Labor costs

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the full tax credit in 2025, you must:

1. Own the solar system (leased systems don't qualify)
2. Install the system on your primary or secondary residence
3. Have the system installed and operational during the 2025 tax year

## State-Level Incentives

In addition to federal tax credits, many states offer their own incentives:

| State | Additional Incentive |
|-------|----------------------|
| California | Property tax exclusion |
| New York | 25% state tax credit (up to $5,000) |
